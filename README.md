<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>
- I used several tags in it. 
</p>
<p>
- I created seperation in page like by using header and main body.
</p>
<p>
- I used div to create the structure, by assignning them or dividing them or classifying them by thier class,id.
</p>
<p>
- I used input, button tag with thier type,value attribute, to get maximum clarity. 
</p>
<p>
- I also assgin both link stylesheet and script js in head and body respectively. 
</p>

<h2>CSS </h2> 
<p>
- I used perticular theme to showcase standardization
</p>
<p> 
- I used downward structure form top to bottom structure to get maximun clarity for reader or for my self, this can be called as GoodPractice. 
</p>
<p>
- I Used two main display methods, like grid and flex whenever required. 
</p>
<p>
- I make sured about the responsiveness over devices, by checking major smallest and largest default device, by this I created responsive webpage. 
</p>
<p>
- I mainly focuses on allignement of webbpage by adding suitable padding and margin, with using vh unit to the height and widht, or by using % in some cases.

<h2>JS</h2>
<p>

</p>
<p>
- Used loops is case of Theme shifter for day and night, by using flag variable. 
</p>
<p>
- Used forEach for the button of calci, cause they have similar functtionallity with different value.
</p>
<p>
